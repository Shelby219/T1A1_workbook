## Q1 Research the development of the internet from 1980 to today. You must describe at least FIVE key events in the development of the internet. You can refer to events, people of significance, or technologies and how they have changed over time.

According to the Cambridge Dictionary the Internet is defined as “the large system of connected computers around the world that allows people to share information and communicate with each other”(Link 1).  Today we see this on an unprecedented scale. We are living in an age of information sharing, in fact an oversharing. From our computers, laptops, tablets, televisions, mobiles, smart watches, daily our lives revolve around information sharing and communication. We can look up a recipe on an iPad in a blink, stream a movie in an instance, video chat with a friend across the globe in a second, go shopping, play games, read books, do a gym class, do an online course, if you can think of it we have it at our finger tips, day or night. However, before the internet was as we know it today, it had a beginning. 

The original foundation of the internet came about from the effort of government-funded computer networking efforts. The predecessor to the internet started with US Department of Defence, Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) establishing the first wide-area packet-switching network called ARPANET (Link 2). This begun via a program established called Internetting, based on the notion of the connecting of more than one network via “gateway” (Link 3). ARPA-funded researchers developed many of the protocols still used on computer networks today (most notably on the Internet). ARPA was also the first to implement the TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) protocol suite, providing end-to-end connectivity specifying how different types of machines on networks around the world to route and assemble data packets (Link 3). Therefor enabling multiple separate networks to be joined by a network of networks. (Link 4).  

By the 1980’s the “open architecture” concept of the TCP/IP method was implemented by other agencies so their researchers could communicate and share data. (Link 2). For example, the National Science Foundation (NSF) were heavily involved with networking starting with establishing Computer Science Network (CSNET) (Link 2), to provide networking services to all university scientists. Then to expand access to the entire scientific and academic community, in 1986 NSFNET, the first large-scale enactment of internet technologies, went online to connect the recently completed supercomputer centres around the US. These supercomputers were built to be shared by scientists and engineers around the country. The NSF also funded various regional research and education networks to connect to the NSFNET ‘backbone’, at this time its links were 1.5 megabits per second. NSFNET was financially self-sufficient and wanted the network to grow and accommodate any traffic that could reach it. To accommodate the influx of Internet-connected computers it became the first 45 megabits per second Internet network in 1991. (Link 2) 

Noting the growth and popularity of the Internet a few commercial firms built their own networks. Since many commercial providers were meeting the needs of the research community, in 1995 the NSF began by awarding contracts for three network access points, and one routing arbiter, to provide connection points between these commercial networks, additionally signing a cooperation agreement to establish the next generation Backbone Network Service.   (link 2)
A notable event was when the NSFNET backbone was decommissioned in April 1995.

Another prominent name in the history of the internet is Tim Berners-Lee. Sir Tim noticed the scientists around the world had difficultly sharing information. (link 6) “In those days, there was different information on different computers, but you had to log on to different computers to get at it. Also, sometimes you had to learn a different program on each computer. Often it was just easier to go and ask people when they were having coffee…”- Tim Berners-Lee. At this time millions of computers were already being connected through the internet and through using hypertext, Berners-Lee determined they could share information. Hypertext is defined as a ‘software system allowing extensive cross-referencing between related sections of text and associated graphic material’. (Link 7). By 1990, Berners-Lee had written the three foundational technologies of today’s web browser, HTML, URL and HTTP. By 1991 the World Wide Web was launched to people outside CERN and subsequently was made freely available to all. Tim also wrote the first web browser WorldWideWeb.app, however a standout early days browser was Mosaic.

Mosaic was developed in 1993 by students and staff working at the NSF-supported National Centre for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) (link8). Mosaic was more sophisticated graphically than other browsers at the time. By January 1993 is was available for free for Unix, but PC and Mac versions followed soon after. With its expansive system availability, it quickly became the browser of choice. Mosaic Communications Corp was incorporated and then developed the Mosaic browser and server software for commercial use. Mosaic was the standout predecessor to the following modern browsers such as Microsoft Internet Explorer. (link 2).

Regarding the road to a commercially workable Internet, a point of contention was the component of the registration of Domain names. The Domain Name System (DNS) is essentially a large database containing the names and IP address of various hosts on the internet, which computers use to locate one another. Initially the Department of Defence funded early registration efforts as registrants were mostly military, then once they because mostly academic registrations, by the Federal Networking Council asking NSF, they held responsibility for non-military registrations. NSF then awarded this service to Network Solutions INC (NSI). Due the fact the new registrations were mostly commercial NSF sanctioned NSI to charge a fee for name registration. In 1993 there were 7,500 domain names and by September 1998 the number had grew pass 2 million.

Privatization of the Internet was in the year 1998 marked the end of NSF’s direct role in the Internet. The commercial sector received the network access points, and routing arbiter functions and an agreement was signed by the Department of Commerce’s National Telecommunications and Information Administration with the non-profit Internet Corporation for Assigned Numbers and Names (ICANN) for domain name registration control. (link 2).

Commercialising the internet meant millions were laying fibre-optic cables and getting online. In an effect to rid of wires and to make the internet portable, wireless LAN (WLAN) was then invented and patented. Dr John O’Sullivan and team at the Commonwealth Science and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), through extensive research into radioastronomy, knowledge of complex mathematics and detailed knowledge of radio waves and their behaviour, the invention of WLAN was born. The issue of interference (radio waves bouncing off indoor surfaces, causing a signal distorting echo) was overcome by this team by building a chip that reduced this echo and improved the signal quality. (link 11 and 12)

After Y2K, the internet truly had changed the world. Even though the “dot.com” bubble killed many internet start-ups but allowed for improvement to the internet infrastructure; this paved the way for what is ‘Web 2.0’. An internet focused on user-generated content and social networking. With the invention of WLAN as mentioned, the internet became even more accessible.

With many Companies like Apple and Google expanding their computer product range exponentially every year, that only enables users to keep expanding their internet use and level of connectivity. The introduction of smartphones, particularly the realise of the Apple iPhone in 2007, redefined the level of connectivity and social media. Facebook, Twitter and Instagram being some of the most popular sites on the internet, all forms of content are able to be shared at the touch of a button, to friends or the whole world. Millions are blogging, vlogging, tweeting, posting, snapping, liking, subscribing and commenting on everything daily. We are now living in a day and age where a job as a “social media influencer” can pay six figures. All of these developments have only been in the last 10 years.  Who knows what the next 10 years of the ever-evolving internet will bring…… (link 10)

## Q12 	Identify and explain the error in the following code that is preventing correct execution of the program
    celsius = gets
    fahrenheit = (celsius * 9 / 5) + 32
    print "The result is: "
    print fahrenheit
    puts "."

## Q13 The following code looks for the first two elements that are out of order and swaps them; however, it is not producing the correct results. Rewrite the code so that it works correctly.

    arr = [5, 22, 29, 39, 19, 51, 78, 96, 84]
    i = 0
    while (i < arr.size - 1 and arr[i] < arr[i + 1])
    i = i + 1 end
    puts i
    arr[i] = arr[i + 1]
    arr[i + 1] = arr[i]

    *********************************************** 
    #the old code did not work as 
    # arr[i] = arr[i + 1] This cancelled each other out so they both then equalled 19
    # arr[i + 1] = arr[i]

    arr = [5, 22, 29, 39, 19, 51, 78, 96, 84]
    i = 0
    while (i < arr.size - 1) and (arr[i] < arr[i + 1])
        i = i + 1 end
    puts i
    other =  arr[i] #setting a variable to equal index 3 which is 39 
    p arr[i] = arr[i + 1] # 19 - then swopping arr[3] to equal arr[3+1] = 19 (previously 4 index)
    p arr[i + 1] = other # 39 - then changing arr[4] to equal other variable to it now equals 39

    #the new array is formed with the index 3 and 4 values swopped. 
    p arr  # [5, 22, 29, 19, 39, 51, 78, 96, 84]


## Q14 Demonstrate your algorithmic thinking through completing the following two tasks, in order:
  ### i. Create a flowchart to outline the steps for listing all prime numbers between 1 and 100 (inclusive). Your flowchart should make use of standard conventions for flowcharts to indicate processes, tasks, actions, or operations  
  ### ii. Write pseudocode for the process outlined in your flowchart


## Q15 Write pseudocode OR Ruby code for the following problem:

### You have access to two variables: raining (boolean) and temperature (integer). If it’s raining and the temperature is less than 15 degrees, print to the screen “It’s wet and cold”, if it is less than 15 but not raining print “It’s not raining but cold”. If it’s greater than or equal to 15 but not raining print “It’s warm but not raining”, and otherwise tell them “It’s warm and raining”.	

    raining = false
    temp = 10

    if (raining == true && temp < 15)
        puts "It’s wet and cold"
    elsif (raining == false && temp < 15)
        puts "It’s not raining but cold"
    elsif (raining == false && temp >= 15)
        puts "It’s warm but not raining"
    else
        puts "It’s warm and raining"
    end





## Q16 An allergy test produces a single numeric score which contains the information about all the allergies the person has (that they were tested for). The list of items (and their value) that were tested are:

#### - eggs (1)
#### - peanuts (2)
#### - shellfish (4)
#### - strawberries (8)
#### - tomatoes (16)
#### - chocolate (32)
#### - pollen (64)
#### - cats (128)
#### So if Tom is allergic to peanuts and chocolate, he gets a score of 34.

### Write a program that, given a person’s score can tell them:
#### a. whether or not they’re allergic to a given item
#### b. the full list of allergies.
